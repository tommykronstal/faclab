This directory contains example scripts and the resulting outputs 
discussed in the papers submitted to CPC. Two versions of the scripts 
are present, one is for Python interface (*.py), and the other is for
SFAC interface (*.sf).

structure/,  atomic structure example for Ne-like Fe.
excitation/, electron impact excitation example for Ne-like Fe.
pirr/,       photoionzation and radiative recombination for Li-like Fe.
aidr/,       autoionization example for Ne-like Se.
ionization/, electron impact ionization example for Ne-like Fe.
FeL/,        a general application to the calculation of Fe-L shell
	     spectrum of collisionally ionized plasma. It includes 
	     the recombination, and ionization processes in the
	     line formation.
polariz/,    use of pfac.pol module to calculate the polarizations of
	     He-like Fe lines.
rmatrix/,    collisional excitation with the Dirac R-matrix method.
